#How to run?
Please open index.html to run this program.

###Additional Information about running
You will not need anything else as long as script.js and style.css are in the same folder as index.html.

###Notes:
1. I have used the following libraries in this program but all are downloaded through CDN;
  * Bootstrap
  * JQuery
  * knockout.js
2. I have used Wikipedia API to get information for locations in Google Map markers
